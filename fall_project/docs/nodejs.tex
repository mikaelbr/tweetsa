Node.js is a platform built on Google's V8 JavaScript Engine. In later years Node.js as grown rapidly in popularity, this much due to its scalability and event driven nature. As Node.js uses a asynchronous non-blocking I/O model, it is perfect for data-intensive real-time applications~\citep{site:nodejs}. Node.js is often refereed to as JavaScript on the server-side. 

The original goal of Node.js was to make web sites be able to push capabilities. That is, for servers to be able to push states to the client, without the client having requested it first. 

Since Node.js is JavaScript based and JSON is a subset of JavaScript, JSON is integrated seamlessly. 

Although Node.js is a fairly new platform, it has a rapid growing user base. Even though Node.js was conceptualized not long ago, and it is not yet released as a stable version, there are about 19 000 modules released for it through the Node Package Manager (NPM)~\citep{site:npm}. There are about 700 000 module downloads each day, using NPM.
