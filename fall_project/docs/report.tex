\section*{Abstract}

Sentiment Analysis (or opinion mining) on Twitter has become very popular in later years. Sentiment and opinion data has a wide range of applications of in fields like marketing research, end-user product research, reviews and more. This has made it a very appealing topic for research.

In the report a systematic literature review is conducted to define the current state-of-the-art for sentiment analysis systems on Twitter data, and an architecture is proposed for building such a system. The proposed system works as a layer on top of the Twitter API, and as such is thoroughly documented, and a lot of developers are already familiar with it. The API layer and the sentiment classification system works in a heavily asynchronous manner which allows for parallel operations and a horizontally scalable system. 

A basic sentiment analysis system is implemented, to work as a proof of concept for the proposed architecture. The classification system is implemented with the use of the AFINN lexicon, specifically designed for sentiment analysis on Twitter.

\section*{Preface}

This specialization project is conducted as a part of a Master's thesis at the Norwegian University of Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. We have used this project as a mean of gaining sufficient knowledge about and defining the state-of-the-art for sentiment analysis systems. This state-of-the-art survey is to be used as a basis for our Master's thesis in the last semester of our studies at NTNU. 


We used a systematic literature review to gain knowledge and finding research papers. This was a new task for us, and we found it useful and educational, but a very demanding process. 


We would like to thank our supervisor Björn Gambäck, and assisting supervisors Amitava Das and Lars Bungum for interesting feedback and for always being engaged in our project. Björn Gambäck always had educational papers on hand and helped us grasp the topic at hand.
