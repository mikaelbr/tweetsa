		\subsubsection{Naive Bayes Classifier}
		The naive Bayed classifier is a highly practical Bayesian learning model that are well known in the field of machine learning. It's used for learning cases where an instance $x$ consists of a number of attribute-value pairs, and the target function $f(x)$ consists of a finite number of values from a set $V$.

The naive bayes classifier is based on an assumption that all the attribute values are conditionally independent given the target value of the instance.
\begin{equation}
\label{equation:nbc}
v_{NB} = P(v_j) \amalg p(a_i|c_j)
\end{equation}

To classify an instance, the NBC needs to calculate the probability estimate $P$ for each attribute $a_i$, given the target value. Then it assigns the target value as the one that gives the highest product of $P$ from the training data.
