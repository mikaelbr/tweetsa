Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) is a multinomial logistic regression model that allows for classification with more than two discrete classes. It has been used for various natural language tasks, such as POS tagging and text segmentation~\citep{article:nigam}.

The MaxEnt models are feature-based, and in binary classification scenarios it is the same as general logistic reasoning. Unlike NB it has no assumptions of conditionally independence, and can therefore be used in .. with feature selection methods like n-grams and extended unigrams (unigrams with negation support)~\citep{article:go}-
