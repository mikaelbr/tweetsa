\chapter{Conclusion}


\textcolor{blue}{(2-3 pages) Time for the conclusion, be short and try to nail down the essence. This should usually 
list the major conclusions from your previous discussion. There should also be a section on possible future directions 
for your work in this chapter.}

\section{Future Work}

A natural way to extend this work, is to add additional classification algorithms as models. There are also several different features that could be investigated and more combinations of pre-processing methods. 

To improve the classification on tweets, and thus make the system less domain independent, more Twitter specific features can be used. E.g. lexica developed specifically for social media, like the~\citet{article:afinn} lexicon. 

It could also be interesting adding POS-tagging as an experiment, using it to classify subjectivity as shown to work by~\citet{article:pak}.

While developing the visualisation application SentiMap, another more specific feature could be seen in the tweets streamed by Twitter. As the tweets were restricted by geographical location, most of them originated from hand held devices. Apples iPhone, has their own smilies, originally intended for the Japan user marked, called Emoji\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji}}. Emoji smilies are different smilies and icons representing situations of sentiments, but not constructed from ASCII characters like regular smilies (e.g. $:($ and $:)$). By translating these Emojies to sentiments like $||Happy||$ or $||Sad||$ they could be used as features.
