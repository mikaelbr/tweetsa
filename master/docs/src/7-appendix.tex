\chapter{Selected Papers}
\textcolor{blue}{P1: \ldots}

% Use this command to include all pages of a pdf-document:
%\includepdf[pages=-,pagecommand={\thispagestyle{empty}}]{myPaper.pdf}

\textcolor{blue}{Normally include the full reference list of each paper. You should also check with your previous 
publisher if they have any special requests for allowing a reprint of your paper in the thesis, like including original 
copyright notice or a thanks to the publisher. Your papers may be uniformly formatted for the thesis. However, this may 
take a lot of effort to go e.g. from two columns to one, so set aside some days for this.}



\chapter{Secondary Papers}

\textcolor{blue}{If you are not including all your papers from the PhD study in the thesis, list the ones you excluded 
- each with general info and abstract only.}


\chapter{Other Stuff}

\textcolor{blue}{Other stuff you want to include for example: collected and processed data, software, empirical tools 
like questionnaires and interview guides etc. – but only if needed.}
